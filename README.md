### Project Euler Solutions

These are some Project Euler solutions in C# that I practiced on in Jul, 2018 during the training period of my first job as a software developer.

If you want to run them, you will need:
 -  Visual Studio, and install the C# Windows Application package.
 - Create a project in Visual Studio and replace the main Program.cs code with one of the solutions I've added to this repo and just build and run.


 All the solutions have been written by me except when explicitly written in the file name or in the code as comments.

I had limited time to solve these problems as my focus was on learning for the job. Also I switched from C# to Python immediately after.
